== Overview

We have a need to be able to upgrade the server components present in a Bootable JAR when building the jar
from the Bootable JAR maven plugin.

2 kind of components can be upgraded:

* JBoss Modules module jar files (eg: undertow-core, postgresql driver that would be provisioned from third party Galleon feature-pack).
* Galleon feature-packs that are dependencies of the Galleon feature-pack(s) in use to build a Bootable JAR.

== Requirements

* The upgrade mechanism is done from the Bootable JAR Maven plugin.

* Components that we want to upgrade are referenced with Maven Coordinates 
(GroupId, ArtifactId, Classifier, Version and Type) from the Maven dependencies section of the Maven project.
That is the nominal Maven way of expressing dependencies.

* We are not automatically using all artifacts present in the project dependencies section for the upgrade.  
A user needs to list the GroupId/ArtifactId/[Classifier] of the artifacts he wants to see used during the upgrade.

* The `wildfly-jar-maven-plugin` configuration is evolved with an `<overridden-server-artifacts>` set that contains the artifacts that 
are in use for the upgrade.

* JBoss Modules jar artifacts and Galleon feature-packs zip artifacts are treated the same way and can be present in the `overridden-server-artifacts` set.

=== Hard Requirements

* This RFE doesn't introduce backward incompatibility.

* This RFE is made possible starting with WildFly 23. Older WildFly release can't be used.

* Usage of Galleon feature-pack location (FPL) to reference the Galleon channel of a producer registered inside a universe) is still possible.

* This mechanism strongly depends on Maven dependency resolution. 
Any artifact to upgrade must be present in accessible Maven repositories (remote or local cache).

* An artifact present in the  `overridden-server-artifacts` set must be present in the dependencies section. 
It is advised that the dependency scope be `provided` to be not included in the application artifact (eg: war).  A warning is displayed if
the scope is not `provided`.
If an artifact is not present in the dependencies, then a failure occurs during build.

* An artifact is referenced in the `overridden-server-artifacts` by GroupId, ArtifactId and optionally Classifier. 
Version being retrieved from the Maven dependencies. 

* An overridden artifact (artifact present in the `overridden-server-artifacts` list) must be unique. Any duplicate will make the packaging to fail.

* Adding an overridden artifact that is not part of the provisioned server artifacts will lead to a failure during build.

* Adding an overridden Galleon feature-pack artifact that is not a dependency of the WildFly server being 
provisioned will lead to an error during packaging. 

* The version of the galleon feature-packs referenced using GAV becomes optional in the maven plugin configuration if the  Galleon 
feature-pack artifact has been added to the dependencies. In this case the version is being retrieved from the dependencies. If the version
is missing and no Feature-pack artifact is retrieved in the dependencies, a failure occurs during packaging.

* Third party galleon feature-packs benefit from this upgrade capability for JBoss Module artifacts they are bringing to the provisioned server.

* The server jar components that can be upgraded are:
** The JBoss module runtime jar (jboss-modules.jar file).
** All jar artifacts referenced from JBoss Modules modules.

* The set of artifacts that can be upgraded can be retrieved by setting the parameter `<dump-original-artifacts>true</dump-original-artifacts> or 
the system property `bootable.jar.dump.original.artifacts` to true when building a bootable JAR. 
The file `target/bootable-jar-build-artifacts/bootable-jar-server-original-artifacts.xml` is generated. 
It contains XML elements for the Galleon feature-packs dependencies, JBoss Modules runtime and artifacts. 
JBoss Modules modules artifacts are grouped by JBoss Modules name.
The generated file contains only the artifacts that are provisioned by Galleon. 
Each artifact version is the one that would get installed when building the Bootable JAR without upgrade.

* An artifact upgraded to the same version as the one referenced in the Galleon feature-pack is not upgraded. In this case a warning is displayed during build.

* It is possible to downgrade an artifact to an older version. In this case a warning is displayed during build. 
Warning can be disabled with `<disable-warn-for-artifact-downgrade>true</disable-warn-for-artifact-downgrade>` element.

Example of an hypotetical `undertow-core` and `wildfly-ee-galleon-pack` upgrade:

```
...
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.undertow</groupId>
            <artifactId>undertow-core</artifactId>
            <version>2.2.4</version>
            <scope>provided</scope>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.wildfly</groupId>
            <artifactId>wildfly-ee-galleon-pack</artifactId>
            <version>23.0.1.Final</version>
            <type>zip</type>
            <scope>provided</scope>
        </dependency>
...

<plugin>
        <groupId>org.wildfly.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>wildfly-jar-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
            <feature-packs>
                <feature-pack>
                    <groupId>org.wildfly</groupId>
                    <artifactId>wildfly-galleon-pack</artifactId>
                    <version>23.0.0.Final</version>
                </feature-pack>
            </feature-packs>
            <layers>
                <layer>jaxrs-server</layer>
            </layers>
            <!-- We list the set of artifacts we want to see replaced during provisioning -->
            <overridden-server-artifacts>
                <artifact>
                    <groupId>io.undertow</groupId>
                    <artifactId>undertow-core</artifactId>
                </artifact>
                <artifact>
                    <groupId>org.wildfly</groupId>
                    <artifactId>wildfly-ee-galleon-pack</artifactId>
                </artifact>
            </overridden-server-artifacts>
        </configuration>
...
```

==== Impact on Preview (EE9) Galleon feature-pack

The Artifact upgrade is operated during provisioning before any EE9 transformation occurs. Upgraded artifacts will be transformed 
even if the original artifact was excluded from the set of transformed artifacts. This seems safer, the fix could have introduced an EE9
incompatible change.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

* NONE

=== Non-Requirements

* Ability to upgrade a local artifact (eg: a jar file) not registered in accessible Maven repository (local or remote).

* Upgrade of a top level Galleon feature-pack (Feature-pack referenced in the plugin configuration 
`<feature-pack-location>` or `<feature-packs>` is out of scope.

* Although technically possible (thanks to WildFly Galleon plugins support for server component upgrade), 
the ability to upgrade server component in Galleon contexts (WildFly S2I build, Galleon Maven provisioning plugin and Galleon CLI) 
other than Bootable JAR are not in the scope of this RFE. 

* The ability to upgrade Galleon feature-pack dependencies in Galleon contexts (WildFly S2I build, Galleon Maven provisioning plugin and Galleon CLI) 
other than Bootable JAR are not in the scope of this RFE.

* JBoss modules artifacts that are Maven dependencies of the Galleon feature-pack can be upgraded. Artifacts that have  GAV hardcoded in JBoss Modules module.xml 
(or with artifact binary packaged inside the Galleon feature-pack) can't be upgraded. 

* Narrowing the artifact upgrade inside a given feature-pack is not supported. Adding such support would imply a new RFE.

== Test Plan

* New tests to cover overridden artifacts added to Bootable JAR Maven plugin.

* New functional tests should be added to QE testsuite.

== Community Documentation

The Maven plugin community documentation will be updated with this new support.

== Release Note Content

Not candidate for release notes.
