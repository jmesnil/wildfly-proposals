== Overview

The Galleon tool is a powerful new tool for doing platform independent provisioning 
and updating of a software installation. The overall Galleon project consists of 
core tooling (https://github.com/wildfly/galleon) that isn't specific to provisioning 
any particular kind of software, and then plugin s(https://github.com/wildfly/galleon-plugins) 
that allow the tool to deal with particular types of software, e.g. WildFly.

The WildFly project intends to use Galleon for its provisioning needs. This initial proposal 
is for a very limited use of Galleon -- using it produce the 'thin' and 'fat' distribution 
zips that are part of a WildFly Core and WildFly release.

This initial work is not really a feature, it is an internal detail of the builds.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

 * Produce a 'core' Galleon feature pack as part of the default WildFly Core maven build.
 * Use that 'core' feature pack to produce a 'thin' core distribution as part of
   the default WildFly Core maven build. 
 ** This distribution should be produced in the 'build' maven module and should
    have the org.wildfly.core:wildly-core-build maven groupId and artifactId. This
    is the traditional location and maven GA for our 'thin' core distribution.
 * Use that 'core' feature pack to produce a 'fat' core distribution as part of
   the default WildFly Core maven build. 
 ** This distribution should be produced in the 'dist' maven module and should
    have the org.wildfly.core:wildly-core-dist maven groupId and artifactId. This
    is the traditional location and maven GA for our 'thin' core distribution.
 * Produce a 'servlet' Galleon feature pack as part of the default WildFly maven build.
 ** This feature pack will depend on the 'core' feature pack.
 * Use that 'servlet' feature pack to produce a 'thin' servlet distribution as part of
   the default WildFly maven build. 
 ** This distribution should be produced in the 'servlet-build' maven module and should
    have the org.wildfly:wildly-servlet-build maven groupId and artifactId. This
    is the traditional location and maven GA for our 'thin' servlet distribution.
 * Use that 'servlet' feature pack to produce a 'fat' servlet distribution as part of
   the default WildFly maven build. 
 ** This distribution should be produced in the 'servlet-dist' maven module and should
    have the org.wildfly:wildly-servlet-dist maven groupId and artifactId. This
    is the traditional location and maven GA for our 'thin' servlet distribution.
 * Produce a 'full' Galleon feature pack as part of the default WildFly maven build.
 ** This feature pack will depend on the 'servlet' feature pack.
 * Use that 'full' feature pack to produce a 'thin' distribution as part of
   the default WildFly maven build. 
 ** This distribution should be produced from the 'build' maven module and should
    have the org.wildfly:wildly-build maven groupId and artifactId. This
    is the traditional location and maven GA for our 'thin' distribution.
 * Use that 'full' feature pack to produce a 'fat' distribution as part of
   the default WildFly maven build. 
 ** This distribution should be produced from the 'dist' maven module and should
    have the org.wildfly:wildly-dist maven groupId and artifactId. This
    is the traditional location and maven GA for our 'thin' distribution.
 * The default WildFly Core maven build should continue to use the legacy 
   org.wildfly.build:wildfly-feature-pack-build-maven-plugin to produce a 'legacy
   core feature pack'. The maven module for this should be the 'core-feature-pack'
   module, and its maven coordinate should be the same
   org.wildfly.core:wildfly-core-feature-pack used in previous releases.
 * The default WildFly maven build should continue to use the legacy 
   org.wildfly.build:wildfly-feature-pack-build-maven-plugin to produce a 'legacy
   servlet feature pack'. The maven module for this should be the 'servlet-feature-pack'
   module, and its maven coordinate should be the same
   org.wildfly:wildfly-servlet-feature-pack used in previous releases.
 * The default WildFly Core maven build should continue to use the legacy 
   org.wildfly.build:wildfly-feature-pack-build-maven-plugin to produce a 'legacy
   full feature pack'. The maven module for this should be the 'feature-pack'
   module, and its maven coordinate should be the same
   org.wildfly:wildfly-feature-pack used in previous releases.
 * These legacy feature packs should be produced in such a way that their output
   would be acceptable for release as the primary build output if this shift to 
   Galleon had not occurred. In other words, these legacy feature packs should be
   usable by users who are accustomed to consuming our feature packs.
 * The WildFly Core maven build should include a profile that builds
   new maven modules that produce 'legacy thin and fat distributions' using the legacy
   org.wildfly.build:wildfly-server-provisioning-maven-plugin. These will use
   the 'legacy core feature pack' discussed previously.
 ** This maven profile should not run by default.
 * The WildFly maven build should include a profile that builds
   new maven modules that produce 'legacy servlet and full thin and fat distributions' 
   using the legacy org.wildfly.build:wildfly-server-provisioning-maven-plugin. These will
   use the 'legacy servlet feature pack' and 'legacy full feature pack' discussed previously.
 ** This maven profile should not run by default.
 * These legacy distributions should be produced in such a way that their output, except 
   for their maven GAVs, would be acceptable for release as the primary build output if 
   this shift to Galleon had not occurred. In other words, these distributions should 
   provide a valid base for comparison to the output of the Galleon build.
 ** The only purpose of these legacy distributions is to facilitate such comparisons.
 * The content of the Galleon-produced distributions should functionally match the output
   of the legacy distributions, with only minimal minor cosmetic differences.
 * Special distributions of the server that are produced inside the WildFly Core and 
   WildFly testsuites should be produced by Galleon, not by legacy tooling.
 ** Copying of distribution content produced in other modules of the build into the
    needed testsuite locations is acceptable; i.e. there is no requirement that
    all test distributions be built using Galleon, just as there was no requirement
    in the past to use the legacy server-provisioning plugin in all places.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

None 

=== Non-Requirements

 * Support for any use of the Galleon tooling outside of the maven build steps described in this document. 
 * Long term support for the initial content details of the Galleon feature packs. The initial version
   of these feature packs should be regarded as 'Tech Preview', i.e. subject to change in the next WildFly 
   release if we discover the need to correct things after this initial use. The intent though is to produce 
   feature packs external parties can look at to learn about how WildFly+Galleon will work and to
   start planning how their own software can be based on our feature packs. 
 * Publication of legacy 'thin' and 'fat' distributions to public maven repositories. These are
   only meant for testing use to verify the Galleon output against the current mechanism output;
   they are not meant for other consumption. Publishing these is actually an anti-requirement.
 * Absolutely identical output content of a thin or fat distribution produced using the legacy tooling and 
   one produced using Galleon. The two are meant to be very, very similar but minor differences that do
   not affect functionality are acceptable. The intent though is to minimize these.
 * The exact same "conceptual" content between a legacy feature pack and its Galleon replacement (i.e. what
   functionality the pack is meant to provide). There may be slight differences.
 * Any similarity at all in terms of the structure or content details of the legacy and Galleon feature 
   packs.
 * Indefinite production of legacy feature packs in future releases. At some point the intent is to drop
   these.
 * Indefinite production of legacy distributions in future releases. At some point the goal of proving
   the correctness of the Galleon build will be considered fulfilled and maintaining the legacy
   distribution builds will not be needed.



== Test Plan

 * The content of the Galleon-produced distributions should be compared to the output of the
   legacy distributions in order to confirm that there are only minor cosmetic differences.
 * Where distributions produced by the WildFly Core and WildFly testsuites are created by Galleon
   this further confirms that Galleon produces output consistent with what the testsuite expects.
